# EOSS to Wikidata

Curating metadata from CZIâ€™s Essential Open Source Software for Science program into Wikidata.

It basically pulls metadata from grants.

The idea is to use the code to add links between people and the software they develod (as names as listed) as well as CZI as a source of funding. 

Strings are reconciled to Wikidata with the help of the [wdcuration](https://github.com/lubianat/wdcuration) package. 

The integration will be done via Quickstatements.
